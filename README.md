# Our team aim to design a billiards robot player. Firstly, the robot will
# sensor the billiards table thoroughly to determine the position of all billiards and color of
# them. Distinguish ours and theirs. Then, calculate the distance from CVE ball to all ours, use a
# awesome algorithm to determine which is the object ball, then choose one feasible path and
# angle to hit the object ball. Try to accomplish the POT. Repeat the steps. Finally, win the game.

# Update1 
# We still have not used any code so far.
# We download the V-REP simulator and test some robots and sensors that are provided. We find that we can accomplish our project with this # simulator. Firstly, we use a sensor to read the positions of all the balls on the desk. After reading the information, we will use an
# algorithm to calculate which ball we need to hit. And we can build a robot to hold a stick to hit the ball into the target. Finally, we
# repeat the the process and hit all balls into the targets. In a word, all above steps is feasible on the simulator basd on our tests.Â 
# We will upload our code here for following update
